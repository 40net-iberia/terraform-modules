# Deployment LoadBalancers for a Fortigate Cluster deployment on the Azure with Terraform
## Introduction

This module IaC is a part of a full deployment of a Fortigate cluster in a sandwich configuration. This terraform code will deploy 

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 0.12.0
* Terraform Provider AzureRM >= 2.24.0
* Terraform Provider Template >= 2.2.0
* Terraform Provider Random >= 3.1.0


## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following components:
   - IMPORTANT: for this deployment be suscceful, it is necesary IP and IDs of Fortigate cluster network interfaces. Deploy first fortigate cluster with module fgt-ha.


## Deployment considerations:
      - Create file terraform.tfvars using terraform.tfvars.example as template 
      - Update variables in var.tf with fortigate cluster deployment
      - You will be charged for this deployment

## Deployment
To deploy the FortiGate-VM to Azure:
1. Create module with source `source = "github.com/jmvigueras/modules/azure/xlb`
2. Customize variables in the `terraform.tfvars.example` and `vars.tf` file as needed.  And rename `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`.
3. Initialize the providers and modules:
   ```sh

   ```sh
   $ terraform plan
   ```
5. Verify output.
6. Confirm and apply the plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform apply
   ```
7. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary:
```sh
Outputs:

ilb_private-ip          = <ILB private IP>
elb_public-ip           = <ELB public IP>
gwlb_frontip_config_id  = <GWLB front-end configuration id>
```

## Destroy the deployment
To destroy the instance, use the command:
